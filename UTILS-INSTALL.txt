ttc is structured to be a thin wrapper on external programs used
to manage and control a board.

This document has information about external programs used by Tim Bird
in his board farm:

== remote execution commands ==
These commands were written by Tim Bird, and support remote execution
of commands on a target board, even when a password is required.
That is, they support specifying the user namd and password for the
operation.  ssh_exec uses the python expect module (pexpect)
and telnet_exec uses the python telnet library.

 * telnet_exec - perform remote command over telnet
 * ssh_exec - perform remote command over ssh

To install these, place them in /usr/local/bin and make sure
they are executable:
 $ sudo chmod a+x /usr/local/bin/telnet_exec
 $ sudo chmod a+x /usr/local/bin/ssh_exec

== powerswitch programs ==
The 'powerswitch' programs are simple programs that use wget
to manipulate a Digital Loggers web powerswitch product.
These programs are included in the 'ttc' distribution.

 * powerswitch-set - set the power of an outlet to either ON or OFF
 * powerswitch-cycle - turn the power of an outlet OFF and back ON again

To install these, place them in /usr/local/bin and make sure
they are executable:
 $ sudo chmod a+x /usr/local/bin/powerswitch-*

== dlipower =
dlipower is a python module and command line tool for working
with Digital Loggers web powerswitch products.

dlipower - obtained from:
  https://github.com/dwighthubbard/python-dlipower.git

installed with:
 * python setup.py install

The dlipower.py becomes available.
(see /usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packiages/dlipower-0.7.165-py2.7.egg)

The dlipower command line tool is put in /usr/local/bin

To use:
 * $ dlipower  - show status of all outlets
 * $ dlipower status 1 - show status of outlet 1
 * $ dlipower on 1 - turn on outlet 1
 * $ dlipower off 3 - turn off outlet 3
 * $ dlipower --help - show usage help
